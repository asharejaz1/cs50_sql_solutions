In 1.sql, write a SQL query to list the titles of all episodes in Cyberchase’s original season, Season 1.


SELECT "title" FROM "episodes" WHERE "season"=1;


In 2.sql, list the season number of, and title of, the first episode of every season.


SELECT "season", "title" FROM "episodes" WHERE "episode_in_season" = 1;


In 3.sql, find the production code for the episode “Hackerized!”.


SELECT "production_code" FROM "episodes" WHERE "title" = 'Hackerized!';



In 4.sql, write a query to find the titles of episodes that do not yet have a listed topic.


SELECT "title" FROM "episodes" WHERE "topic" IS NULL;


In 5.sql, find the title of the holiday episode that aired on December 31st, 2004.


SELECT "title" FROM "episodes" WHERE air_date = '2004-12-31';



In 6.sql, list the titles of episodes from season 6 (2008) that were released early, in 2007.


SELECT "title" FROM "episodes" WHERE "season" = 6 AND (air_date BETWEEN '2007-01-01' AND '2007-12-31');


In 7.sql, write a SQL query to list the titles and topics of all episodes teaching fractions.


SELECT "title", "topic" FROM "episodes" WHERE "topic" LIKE 'fractions';


In 8.sql, write a query that counts the number of episodes released in the last 6 years, from 2018 to 2023, inclusive. You might find it helpful to know you can use BETWEEN with dates, such as BETWEEN '2000-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'.


SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "episodes" WHERE "air_date" BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';



In 9.sql, write a query that counts the number of episodes released in Cyberchase’s first 6 years, from 2002 to 2007, inclusive.


SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "episodes" WHERE "air_date" BETWEEN '2002-01-01' AND '2007-12-31';



In 10.sql, write a SQL query to list the ids, titles, and production codes of all episodes. Order the results by production code, from earliest to latest.


SELECT "id", "title", "production_code" FROM "episodes" ORDER BY production_code ASC;



In 11.sql, list the titles of episodes from season 5, in reverse alphabetical order.


SELECT "title" FROM "episodes" WHERE "season" = 5 ORDER BY "title" DESC;


In 12.sql, count the number of unique episode titles.


SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT("title")) FROM "episodes";


In 13.sql, write a SQL query to explore a question of your choice. This query should:
Involve at least one condition, using WHERE with AND or OR

SELECT "title" FROM "episodes" WHERE ("topic" IS NULL) AND "air_date" BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';


Advanced Question 1 : Write a SQL query to find the titles of episodes that have aired during the holiday season, usually in December in the United States.
Your query should output a table with a single column for the title of each episode.
Try to find a better solution than LIKE if you can!


SELECT "title" FROM "episodes" WHERE "air_date" LIKE '____-12-__';

SELECT ”title”, ”air_date” FROM ”episodes” WHERE strftime('%m', ”air_date”) = '12';


Advanced Question 2 : Write a SQL query to find, for each year, the first day of the year that PBS released a Cyberchase episode.
Your query should output a table with two columns, one for the year and one for the earliest month and day an episode was released that year.

SELECT strftime('%Y', ”air_date”) AS year,  MIN(”air_date”) AS first_release_date FROM ”episodes” GROUP BY “year” ORDER BY ”year”;
